# RNN_video_object_detection

This is the implementation of our BMVC 2016 paper "Context Matters: Refining Object Detection in Video with Recurrent Neural Networks".

1. It includes conversion of YOLO binary weight file to python weights
2. finetuning YOLO with theano and lasagne for youtube-objects dataset : DA-YOLO as referred in the paper, the pseudo-label generator
3. GRU training and evaluation code and visual results.

** The code requires cleaning, which I'll eventually do. **
